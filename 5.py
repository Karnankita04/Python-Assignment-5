# 1. Write a python script to remove the last digit from a given number. (for example, if
# user enters 2534 then your output should be 253)
# code: 
# num=int(input("Enter a number: "))
# print(num//10)

# 2. Write a python script to get the last digit from a given number. (for example, if user
# enters 2089 then your output should be 9)
# code: 
# num=int(input("Enter a number: "))
# print(num%10)

# 3. Write a python script to swap data of two variables
# code: 
# a=int(input('Enter value of a'))
# b=int(input('Enter value of b')) 
# # Python_style 
# # a,b=b,a
# # a=a*b 
# # b=a//b
# # a=a//b 
# print("a =",a,"b =",b)

# 4. Write a python script to find x power y, where values of x and y are given by user
# code: 
# x=int(input("Enter the base: "))
# y=int(input("Enter the power: "))
# print(x**y)

# 5. Write a python script which takes a three digit number from the user and displays
# only its first digit.
# code: 
# x=int(input("Enter a three digit number: "))
# print((x//100))

# 6. Write a python script which takes a three digit number from the user and displays
# only its middle digit.
# code: 
# x=int(input("Enter a three digit number: "))
# print((x//10)%10)

# 7. Write a python script which takes a three digit number from the user and displays
# only its last digit.
# code: 
# x=int(input("Enter a three digit number: "))
# print(x%10)

# 8. Write a python script to use IN operator to display the data present in the list
# code: 
# list=[1.3,'Ankita',5,True]
# for i in list:
#     print(i,end=",")

# 9. Write a python script to use NOT IN operator to display the data not present in list
# code: 
# list=[1.3,'Ankita',5,True]
# print(8 not in list)

# 10. Write a python script to use IS operator to display if both variables are the same
# object or not?
# code: 
# a=5
# b=5
# print(a is b) # "is" gives true if the id of both variable is same
